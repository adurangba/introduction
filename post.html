    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I aspire to significantly advance my skills and expertise over
            the next two years. With a solid foundation in Excel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Power BI, and
            Tableau, my goals encompass both web development and data analysis, aiming to become proficient in these
            domains and leverage them effectively in real-world applications.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Web Developer Goals</h2>

        <h3>Master Frontend Technologies</h3>
        <p>I plan to delve deeper into frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular, learning their nuances to create
            responsive and interactive user interfaces. This includes mastering CSS for styling and animations, ensuring
            a seamless user experience across various devices.</p>

        <h3>Enhance Backend Skills</h3>
        <p>Alongside frontend development, improving my backend skills is crucial. I aim to deepen my understanding of
            server-side languages such as Python and Node.js, and explore database management with SQL and NoSQL
            databases. This knowledge will empower me to architect scalable and efficient backend systems that support
            complex applications.</p>

        <h3>Improve Version Control Skills</h3>
        <p>Effective collaboration and project management are key in software development. Therefore, mastering Git and
            GitHub will be a priority. Understanding branching strategies, pull requests, and continuous integration
            workflows will streamline development processes and ensure version control best practices.</p>

        <h3>Deploy and Maintain Applications</h3>
        <p>Beyond development, deploying applications using cloud services like AWS or Azure will be essential. Learning
            about containerization with Docker and implementing CI/CD pipelines will enable me to deploy applications
            seamlessly and maintain them efficiently over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Analyst Goals</h2>

        <h3>Master Data Analysis Tools</h3>
        <p>Building on my proficiency in Excel and SQL, I aim to master advanced data analysis and visualization tools
            such as Power BI and Tableau. These tools will enable me to manipulate and visualize data effectively,
            uncovering trends and patterns that drive business decisions.</p>

        <h3>Improve Data Cleaning and Preparation Skills</h3>
        <p>Data quality is paramount. Strengthening my skills in data cleaning and preprocessing will involve handling
            missing data, dealing with outliers, and ensuring data consistency. This ensures that the insights derived
            from data are accurate and reliable.</p>

        <h3>Enhance Statistical Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Deepening my knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics is crucial for meaningful data analysis.
            This includes hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other statistical techniques that provide
            insights into relationships within data sets.</p>

        <h3>Gain Insights from Data</h3>
        <p>Ultimately, the goal of data analysis is to extract actionable insights. I aim to develop the ability to
            interpret data trends, create comprehensive reports, and present findings in a clear and impactful manner.
            This involves understanding the context of data and translating it into actionable strategies for
            stakeholders.</p>

        <h3>Learn Machine Learning Basics</h3>
        <p>Looking ahead, integrating machine learning into data analysis workflows is becoming increasingly valuable.
            By acquiring a foundational understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques, I aim to explore
            predictive analytics and automate decision-making processes based on data-driven models.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, my two-year tech goals encompass both web development and data analysis, leveraging my current
            skills in Excel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Power BI, SQL, and Tableau. Through dedicated learning,
            hands-on projects, and continuous improvement, I aspire to become proficient in frontend and backend web
            technologies, excel in data analysis and visualization, and harness the power of machine learning to drive
            innovation and efficiency. These goals are not just about acquiring technical skills but also about applying
            them effectively to solve real-world challenges and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry's dynamic
            landscape.</p>
